# Project Labyrinth

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

If we had more time, we would
- have the setHistory action working as intended; right now an empty array is added as the first element in the history array instead of content from the second fetch,
- use of a design library for the loading state,
- style the GameScreen conditionally based on the description received from the API,


## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
